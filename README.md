## PROJECT DISCRIPTION

The following is an overview of a proposed Internet of Things (IoT) project, which aims to develop a sophisticated smart home system that can be controlled and monitored remotely. The project will utilize a range of powerful tools and technologies, with the PYNQ-Z2 development board serving as the hardware platform.

To create a containerized environment for the application, Docker will be employed. This approach allows for efficient management of dependencies and the ability to deploy the application to various devices without compatibility concerns. Portainer will be utilized to manage the Docker containers, providing visibility of resource usage and logs, as well as ease of management.

Connectivity to the cloud will be achieved through the utilization of the Azure Software Development Kit (SDK). This feature allows for remote control and monitoring of the smart home system, as well as data storage and running of machine learning models in the cloud.

The user interface for controlling and monitoring the smart home system will be developed using OpenRemote, an open-source platform that enables the creation of customized dashboards and automation of tasks based on sensor data and other inputs.

In conclusion, this IoT project seeks to demonstrate the capabilities of utilizing various technologies such as Docker, Portainer, Azure SDK, OpenRemote and PYNQ-Z2 development board to create a smart home system that is both powerful and user-friendly. The project aims to highlight the potential of utilizing edge devices and cloud platforms in concert to achieve advanced functionality.
