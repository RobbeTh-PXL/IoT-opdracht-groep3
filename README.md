# **IoT_opdracht_groep3**

## GOALS

Door middel van Azure OpenRemote docker containers builden om updates uit te voeren. <br>
Via Azure SDK een data stroom naar de cloud verzenden.<br>

## TOOLS

* Pynq-Z2 development board
* Docker
* Portainer
* Azure SDK

## PROJECT DISCRIPTION

In this IoT project, we will be using a number of powerful tools to create a smart home system that can be controlled and monitored from anywhere. Our hardware platform will be the PYNQ-Z2 development board, which is a powerful platform for running machine learning models on edge devices.

First, we will use Docker to create a containerized environment for our application. This allows us to easily manage dependencies and deploy our application to different devices without worrying about compatibility issues.

Next, we will use Portainer to manage our Docker containers. This powerful tool allows us to easily view and manage the containers running on our PYNQ-Z2, as well as monitor their resource usage and logs.

We will also use the Azure SDK to connect our system to the cloud. This allows us to remotely control and monitor our smart home system, as well as store data and run machine learning models in the cloud.

Finally, we will use OpenRemote to create a user-friendly interface for controlling and monitoring our smart home system. This open-source platform allows us to create custom dashboards and automate tasks based on sensor data and other inputs.

With these powerful tools, we can create a smart home system that is both powerful and easy to use. By using the PYNQ-Z2 development board and the Azure SDK, we can easily run machine learning models on edge devices and connect to the cloud for additional processing power and storage. And by using Docker, Portainer, and OpenRemote, we can easily manage and monitor our system and create a user-friendly interface for controlling it.

Overall this IoT project would be a great way to explore the capabilities of these tools, and learn how to connect edge devices and cloud platform to create a powerful and user-friendly smart home system.
